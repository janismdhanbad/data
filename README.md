# internshala_scrapper
This repository has a python scrapper which would be of use to you for scrapping all the internships present on a particular 
page on internshala. You could further use it to notify you about the deadline or applying dates of your favourite internships.
It's a fun project.

just import the python file scrapper_internshala.py
initialise the class with

i = scrape()

i.internshala("https://internshala.com/internships/data%20science-internship/page-1")

This will make a file called internship.csv which has all the internships. There is also an ipynb for understanding the code.
